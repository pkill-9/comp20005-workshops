\begin{frame}{Challenge}
    You are standing at an unmarked intersection. One way goes to Sydney, 
    and the other way to Melbourne.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item People from Sydney always lie.
        \item People from Melbourne always tell the truth.
    \end{itemize}
    A person from one of these places (you don't know which) is standing at
    the intersection. Is there a question you can ask to find out the way to
    Melbourne?

    \begin{block}{Outcomes}
        At the end of todays class, you should know how to:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Write simple C programs using the jEdit text editor.
            \item Compile and run C programs using a command line.
            \item Use IO functions and arithmetic operators in C.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Example: IO Basics}
    Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, read them in
    from the terminal, and then compute the sum, difference, product and
    quotient of the two numbers.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Tasks for today}
    \begin{block}{Write, compile and execute}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Exercise 1.2 (blue) 1.3 (yellow): Hello World program.
            \item Exercise 2.8 (blue) 2.6 (yellow): Fahrenheit to Celsius
                conversion.
