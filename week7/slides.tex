\section{Exercise: 7.1}
\stepcounter{subsection}

\begin{frame}{7.1}
    Write a function \tt{int all\_zero(int a[], int n)} which returns true
    if the the elements \tt{a[0]} to \tt{a[n - 1]} are all zero.
\end{frame}

\section{Exercise: 7.2}
\stepcounter{subsection}

\begin{frame}{7.2}
    Modify the bubblesort program from the book so that the array is sorted
    into decreasing order.
\end{frame}

\section{Exercise: 7.3}
\stepcounter{subsection}

\begin{frame}{7.3}
    Modify your bubblesort program even further so that once the array has
    been sorted, only distinct values remain in the array (with the length
    variable reduced accordingly).
\end{frame}

        With your knowledge of arrays, you will be able to complete stage
        3 of the project, and further refine your implementation of stages
        1 and 2.

%  _________________________________________
% /  There was once a programmer who worked \
% | upon microprocessors. "Look at how well |
% | off I am here," he said to a mainframe  |
% | programmer who came to visit, "I have   |
% | my own operating system and file        |
% | storage device. I do not have to share  |
% | my resources with anyone. The software  |
% | is self-consistent and easy-to-use. Why |
% | do you not quit your present job and    |
% | join me here?"                          |
% |                                         |
% | The mainframe programmer then began to  |
% | describe his system to his friend,      |
% | saying: "The mainframe sits like an     |
% | ancient sage meditating in the midst of |
% | the data center. Its disk drives lie    |
% | end-to-end like a great ocean of        |
% | machinery. The software is as           |
% | multi-faceted as a diamond and as       |
% | convoluted as a primeval jungle. The    |
% | programs, each unique, move through the |
% | system like a swift-flowing river. That |
% | is why I am happy where I am."          |
% |                                         |
% | The microcomputer programmer, upon      |
% | hearing this, fell silent. But the two  |
% | programmers remained friends until the  |
% | end of their days.                      |
% |                                         |
